MARUJI - まるじ - 〇字
======

**THIS APPLICATION IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, VERY FAR FROM COMPLETION!**

This is the Japanese language learning tool focused on kanji and vocabulary. Knowing kana is a requirement for using this application.

Core principles
---------------

Design of this application is based on these principles:

1. Kanji should be learned [in a proper order](https://github.com/scriptin/topokanji).

2. One cannot learn kanji separately from the rest of the Japanese language, and it makes the most sense to learn kanji together with words which include them.

3. There is no such thing as "meaning of a kanji", so this type of information is not used in this application. Words, however, have meanings, and this is what should be learned. Read these, if you haven't already:

    - [Japanese don't learn kanji meanings?](http://japanese.stackexchange.com/q/9570/9222)
    - [You can't "learn" Kanji!](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/blog/2014/06/23/you-cant-learn-kanji/)

4. Human brain always looks for ways to "cheat", i.e. to find any kinds of shortcuts which would simplify any given task. This causes a typical problem of not being able to recognize the kanji you've just learned in some other popular applications. It goes like this:

    1. You download yet another "Awesome Kanji Memorization Senpai-Samurai" application
    2. You learn that the "日" means "a day"
    3. Senpai-Samurai asks you to select a correct kanji for "a day" from those: 鼻, 日, 顔, 薬
    4. Since the other three do not make any sense yet, you choose "日"
    5. Senpai-Samurai sets you memorization rate to 100%! You're awesome, but not quite as awesome as the author or Senpai-Samurai
    6. Repeat previous steps multiple times
    7. With a deep feeling of success with your accomplishments (your memorization is still at 70-90%, according to Senpai-Samurai), you go to the internets to apply your Great Knowledge
    8. You can't read shit and feel stupid

    You fail at learning kanji because your brain is very successful at learning other things! It learned how to exclude wrong options from a list, so that you don't even have to look at the correct answer to select it in the Senpai-Samurai app, but the problem is that this doesn't work in real use cases of kanji, when there are no answer options.

5. You're not in school (at least, it is not important here), so no marks should be given. The only measure of your success at learning Japanese is your ability to read, write, and speak Japanese.

6. No software product is enough to learn a language. If you want to learn Japanese, go talk to people who already know Japanese. They'll teach you the language; this application is just a way to optimize and simplify the process a bit.
